Phase 1

goal take files out and scan them through yara giving them either a safe or dangerous flag

we should have options to scan a singular file, a directory and all of its sub directorys and then
the whole computer

create a scanner that can take the files out

| Step | What Youâ€™ll Build     | File             | Description                                           |
| ---- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Directory scanner     | `scanner.py`     | Recursively finds files to scan                       |
| 2    | YARA loader + matcher | `signature.py`   | Loads `.yar` rules and applies them to files          |
| 3    | Sample rule file      | `yara_rules.yar` | Simple dummy virus signature for testing              |
| 4    | Hook them together    | `main.py`        | Ask for directory, scan it, apply YARA, print results |



scanner:

input a path

output: a list of everysingle filepath in that folder and its subdirectorys


For the yara rule set we will find a good one and that is free to use how ever we want and creddit the creator
